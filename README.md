## 🛠️ The Nodes

### 1. 📝 Prompt Queue
**Iterate through prompt lines one by one.**

Instead of randomizing a list, this node strictly follows the order of your text. It is perfect for testing specific prompt variations or storytelling sequences.

> **How it works:**  
> Paste a multi-line list of prompts. Every time you queue a generation, the node outputs the *next* line in the list.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prompts** | The multi-line text input. |
| **On End** | Behavior when the list finishes: `empty` (stop outputting), `repeat_last` (keep sending the last line), or `loop` (start over). |
| **Reset Trigger** | Change this integer value to force the queue back to line 1. |
| **Strip / Skip** | Automatically cleans up whitespace and ignores empty lines. |

</details>

---

### 2. 📂 Prompt Queue (From Folder)
**Batch processing made simple.**

Stop copying and pasting. Point this node to a folder on your computer, and it will read text files (`.txt`, `.json`, etc.) one by one.

> **Use Case:**  
> Great for processing wildcards, long metadata files, or batch-generating images based on a library of text descriptions stored locally.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Folder Path** | The absolute path to your directory (e.g., `C:/Prompts`). |
| **Extensions** | Comma-separated list of file types to read (default: `txt, json`). |
| **On End** | `empty` (returns empty string), `loop` (starts at first file), `hold_last` (repeats last file). |
| **Outputs** | Returns both the **content** of the file and the **filename**. |

</details>

---

### 3. 🎥 Camera Angle Control
**Professional camera descriptions without the hassle.**

Generating specific camera angles in Stable Diffusion can be hit-or-miss. This node constructs precise camera prompts based on rotation, height, depth, and focal length.

**Three Output Modes:**
1. **Natural:** "camera rotated slightly to the right, camera raised high angle..."
2. **Technical:** "rotation 45.0°, vertical up 30.0..."
3. **Keywords:** "right side view, high angle, close-up..."

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

*   **Rotation:** Pan the camera around the subject (Front → Side → Rear).
*   **Vertical:** Move the camera up or down (Bird's Eye → Eye Level → Worm's Eye).
*   **Depth:** Push in or pull out (Macro → Close-up → Wide Shot).
*   **Focal Length:** Simulate lens compression (24mm Wide Angle to 600mm Super Telephoto).
*   **Prefix/Suffix:** Add extra framing text easily.

</details>

---

### 4. 📐 Resolution Selector (Groups)
**Standardized resolutions with aspect ratios.**

Stop guessing pixel dimensions. This node groups resolutions by Megapixel count (0.25MP to 4MP) and provides standard aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 4:3, 21:9, etc.).

> **Logic:**  
> Select a resolution from the dropdown, then **Enable** the switch for that group. The node prioritizes the highest enabled quality group (e.g., if both 1MP and 4MP are enabled, it uses 4MP).

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Available Resolutions</b></summary>

*   **0.25MP:** SD 1.5 style small generations.
*   **0.6MP:** Intermediate sizes.
*   **1MP (Default):** Standard SDXL / SD 1.5 Hi-Res.
*   **2MP - 4MP:** High-resolution upscaling targets.
*   **Aspect Ratios:** Covers 1:1, 4:3, 3:4, 3:2, 2:3, 16:9, 9:16, 21:9, 9:21.

</details>

---

### 5. 🖼️ Image Resolution Fit
**Resize images while keeping aspect ratio.**

Allows you to resize an input image to a specific Megapixel target (e.g., 1MP, 2MP) without distorting it. The node automatically calculates the correct width and height to preserve the original shape and rounds dimensions to multiples of 8.

> **Use Case:**  
> Perfect for Image-to-Image workflows where you want to upscale or downscale a source image to a standard generation size (like 1024x1024 total pixels) but don't want to crop or stretch it.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resolution Select** | Choose the target Megapixel count (0.25MP to 4MP). |
| **Logic** | Calculates `sqrt(target_pixels / current_pixels)` to scale both dimensions equally. |
| **Outputs** | Returns the resized **Image**, a matching empty **Latent**, and the new **Width/Height**. |

</details>

---

### 6. 📏 Image Resolution Extractor
**Get dimensions without resizing.**

A utility node that passes an image through unchanged but extracts its width and height. It also creates a matching empty latent.

> **Use Case:**
> Use this when you want to use an uploaded image as a reference (e.g., for ControlNet) and need an empty latent that matches its exact dimensions.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Image** | The input image. |
| **Outputs** | Returns `Width`, `Height`, a matching `Latent`, and the original `Image`. |

</details>

---

### 7. ✖️ Multiplication (Dual & Latent)
**Mathematical scaling for custom upscaling.**

Takes two integer inputs (like Width and Height) and an optional Latent, and multiplies them by a float factor.

> **Use Case:**  
> Use this for "1.5x Upscales" or "2x Hires Fix". Connect your base width/height, set the multiplier to `1.5`, and feed the output into your latent upscaler or resize node.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multiplier** | The scaling factor (e.g., `1.5` or `2.0`). |
| **Inputs** | Accepts two Integers (`value_1`, `value_2`) and a `Latent`. |
| **Outputs** | Returns the multiplied integers and the bilinearly interpolated latent. |

</details>

---

### 8. 🧹 VRAM/RAM Cleaner
**Manage your resources mid-workflow.**

A "Pass-through" node that can connect to **any** input (Model, VAE, Image, etc.). It passes the data through unchanged but triggers a garbage collection and VRAM flush event when executed.

> **Modes:**  
> 1. **Current:** Unloads the specific model passing through the node.  
> 2. **Others:** Unloads everything else, keeping only the passing model in VRAM.  
> 3. **All:** Unloads everything to system RAM (clean slate).

---

### 9. 🎮 Flow Control (Sidecar Bypass)
**Toggle nodes On/Off remotely.**

A control panel that connects to up to 4 other nodes. This acts as a "Sidecar" — it does not sit in the flow of data, but rather controls the logic of the connected nodes.

> **How it works:**
> 1. Connect a node (e.g., a KSampler or ControlNet) to an `input` slot.
> 2. Toggle the switch on this node.
> 3. **Off (BYPASS):** Forces the connected node into Bypass mode (purple).
> 4. **Active:** Forces the connected node into Always/Normal mode.

---

### 10. 🔀 Any Passthrough
**Universal rerouting tools.**

Use these to clean up "spaghetti" wires or create fallback logic. These nodes accept **any** connection type (Model, Image, String, Latent, etc.).

*   **Any Passthrough (6 → 1):** Takes up to 6 inputs. Outputs the **first** one that is not null. Great for fallback defaults.
*   **Any Passthrough (1 → 6):** Takes 1 input and duplicates it to 6 outputs. Great for organizing wires from a single source.

---

### 11. ⏱️ Add Delay
**Pause execution for debugging.**

A simple node that connects to any data type, waits for a specified number of seconds, and then passes the data through unchanged. Useful for timing API calls or debugging complex flows.

---

### 12. 📺 Show Text
**Display text directly on the graph.**

Connect any string output (like the `Prompt Queue` or `Camera Angle Control`) to this node. It will display the text content inside a widget box on the node itself. Useful for verifying what is actually being sent to your CLIP encoder.

---

### 13. 🎨 CLIP Text Encode (Prompt Enrichment)
**Standard conditioning with built-in style power.**

Why copy-paste "masterpiece, best quality, 4k..." every time? This node acts exactly like the standard CLIP Text Encode but includes a dropdown with **20 curated style presets**.

> **Use Case:**
> Quickly test how your prompt looks in "Anime Style" vs "Photographic" without rewriting your text, or use utility presets like "White Background" for assets.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Text** | Your main prompt input. |
| **Preset** | Choose from 20 styles including: *Cinematic, Digital Art, Dark Fantasy, 3D Render, Crisp/Sharp Focus, Huge Scene, White Background, etc.* |
| **Behavior** | Appends the specific style keywords to the end of your prompt and generates the Conditioning. |

</details>

---

### 14. 🖱️ Visual Marquee (Interactive)
**Pause, Select, and Refine.**

A Human-in-the-Loop tool that pauses your workflow and opens a popup editor over your generated image. You can draw a crop box to select a specific area, then resume the workflow to process just that area.

> **How it works:**
> 1. The node generates a preview and pauses the execution.
> 2. A popup appears in your browser. Draw a selection box.
> 3. Click **Confirm**. The workflow resumes, outputting the cropped image, a mask, and tile coordinates.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Max Resolution** | If `Original Size` is disabled, the crop will be upscaled/downscaled so the longest side matches this value. |
| **Original Size** | **True:** Returns the exact pixels you selected. **False:** Resizes the selection to `Max Resolution`. |
| **Outputs** | `cropped_image`, `mask`, and `tile_data` (required for merging back later). |

</details>

---

### 15. 🧩 Tile Compositor (Merge)
**Seamlessly paste refined details back.**

The partner node to **Visual Marquee**. After you have processed/upscaled/inpainted your cropped area, this node puts it back into the original full-size image at the exact correct coordinates.

> **Features:**
> *   **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically handles size differences if you upscaled the crop in the middle of the workflow.
> *   **Feathering:** Blends the edges of the pasted tile to prevent visible seams.

---

### 16. 💎 Detail Enhancer
**Inject texture and crispness.**

A specialized node that manipulates the noise schedule (Sigmas) to force the model to generate more high-frequency detail. It works by "slowing down" the sampling process during the critical detail-formation phase and artificially inflating noise values.

> **Variants:**
> *   **Detail Enhancer (Sampler):** Wraps a sampler node.
> *   **Detail Enhancer (Sigmas):** Modifies the Sigmas connection directly.

<details>
<summary><b>🔻 Click for Parameters & Features</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enhance Factor** | Time Dilation. Slows down sampling in the active zone (e.g., `2.0` = 2x steps in zone). Adds structural detail. |
| **Texture Boost** | Sigma Inflation. Increases noise values (e.g., `0.5`). Adds sharp, gritty texture. |
| **Start / End %** | The range of the generation where the effect applies (Default `0.1` to `0.8`). |

</details>
